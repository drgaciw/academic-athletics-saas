Meet with Study Abroad Office early (ideally 6-12 months before)\n2. Get course pre-approval from your academic advisor\n3. Check with Compliance Office on eligibility impact\n4. Coordinate with coaching staff on timing\n5. Ensure credits will transfer properly\n\nMany programs offer summer or winter break options that work well with athletic schedules.
