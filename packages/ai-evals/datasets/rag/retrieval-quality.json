        "answer": "Withdrawing from a course can affect your eligibility in several ways: 1) It may drop you below the 12-credit full-time minimum, 2) Withdrawn credits don't count toward your 24-credit or 18-credit requirements, 3) They don't count toward degree progress (40-60-80 rule). You MUST get approval from your academic advisor AND compliance office before withdrawing from any course. Strategically timed withdrawals can sometimes help protect your GPA, but they must be carefully planned to maintain eligibility.",
